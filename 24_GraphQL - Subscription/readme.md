### Setting Subscription

1.  Install subscriptions-transort-ws to enable websocket connection  
    **yarn add @apollo/client subscriptions-transport-ws**
2.  Import all needed modules and separate between http and websocket link.

3.  Create httpLink for query and mutation. And wsLink for subscription. Add header for
    authentication. Get this link from your hasura console. WsLink use wss:// instead of https://
    because wsLink use websocket..

        **Note** that wss is more secure than ws, just like https is more secure than http.

4.  Add split function and use as link when create client. Split function used to combine those two Links into a single Link that uses one or the other according to the type of operation being
    executed . When operation is equal subscription then use wsLink, if not then use httpLink for query and mutation.

### Subscription using subscribeToMore

7. subscribeToMore is a function that enables you to execute a subscription, usually to subscribe to specific fields that
   were included in the guery. Or when server return only 1 updated data instead of all data, then we need to update
   previous data in prev variable and return updated data.
